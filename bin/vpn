# Looks for a VPN connection (assumes that there is only 1)
# and allows it to be brought up/down via the command line.
#
# Additional VPN setup notes:
#   For Network Manager, I got the following to work.
#   In Settings -> Network -> VPN click the gear icon beside the VPN connection
#   and tick "Use this connection only for resources on its network' for both
#   the IPv4 and IPv6 tabs. Then from the command line enter the command
#   nmcli con modify pfSense-<Fill in your connection name here> ipv4.dns-search kepler.gdn,sat,kepler.internal,pfsense.kepler,kepler.engineering,kepler.lan
#   The nmcli command is a one-time thing. It survives across up/down/reboot.
#   Once you've done that I verified that could access wiki.kepler.lan and
#   traceroute www.yahoo.com showed me that the packets were going out to my
#   ISP and not through 10.x.x.x.
